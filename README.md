# JavaScript Solid Utilities ![CI](https://github.com/NoelDeMartin/solid-utils/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)

These are some JavaScript utilities I use in [Solid](https://solidproject.org) projects. If you want to use them as well, you're most welcome. You can install the package with:

```sh
npm install @noeldemartin/solid-utils
```
