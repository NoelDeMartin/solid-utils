# JavaScript Utilities for Solid projects [![Build Status](https://noeldemartin.semaphoreci.com/badges/solid-utils/branches/main.svg)](https://noeldemartin.semaphoreci.com/projects/solid-utils)

These are some JavaScript utilities I use in [Solid](https://solidproject.org) projects. If you want to use them as well, you're most welcome. You can install the package with:

```sh
npm install @noeldemartin/solid-utils
```
